For reflections this week I chose an infographic fom FiveThirtyEight about the history of every Olympic sport. 
For one, I haven't really seen a chart like this before with the amount of squares to accurately represent each piece of data. 
I thought it was smart how they simply go from oldest games to the newer ones so it's easier to read as you go further down the infographic. 
The color difference between summer and winter games is not confusing and makes sense based on the hot/cold color scheme. 
The gradient they have also makes the chart more appealing without having too much to look at. 
This also does a great way of depicting sports that are omitted for X amount of years. I had no idea that golf was out for that many years.

I've always enjoyed watching the Olympics. Seeing the opening ceremonies with all the athletes proud to represent their countries. 
And it's interesting to see how each host country displays their respective cultures and ways of life in the ceremonies for the world to see. 
Since nowadays everyone and everything seems isolated and divided, it's nice to think of times of togetherness.
