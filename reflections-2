It is its own website, but I've never seen or heard of it before. I've always been amazed but still slightly terrified of space. 
And I thought this visualization was pretty cool and interactive.
The orbit of the planets is nice and clear, and I guess I never realized how far away the outer planets are.
I already thought it was pretty impressive by the zoom feature to see all the asteroids around us, but the interactive feature is really neat. 
You can click on any of the asteroids to see their respective orbit as well, and it's interesting to see just how different they all are.
Although I understand its intent, I do feel like it is a little cluttered with the number of asteroids, but since they serves more of an observational purpose it is understandable.
It does say that it only shows objects larger than 10km because that's what NASA's Solar Systems Dynamics deems a "Near Earth Object."
But it also is interesting to see how many there are of that size and we don't need to really worry about them.
It isn't exactly finalized or 100% accurate according to their website, but it is still a very interesting visual nonetheless.
